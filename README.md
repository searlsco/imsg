## Install

```
brew install searlsco/tap/imsg
```

## Features

- **Export your Messages** to a static HTML website you can open as a file without running a server
- **Display attached files and media** like images, video, and audio. Clicking a file reveals it in Finder
- **Search transcripts** and jump to any point in a conversation
- **Filter threads** to find the one you're looking for
- **Merge contacts into combined threads, like Messages does** by cross-referencing your Contacts database or an address book export

You can export a single conversation or an archive of all of them. Long threads are loaded in gradually as you scroll and search, improving the archive's responsiveness.

## Why to use this

Whether you're backing up your own Messages or archiving a loved one's texts, exporting a backup of your message database as a portable web archive means you'll be able to continue to revisit it for years and decades to come. Because Apple's own Messages and Contacts apps' data is predominantly stored in proprietary formats, it may become difficult or impossible to recover very old backups with the current versions of those applications.

Also Apple's search sucks and this search is fast, simple, and mostly works.

## What you'll need

This tool was designed around the macOS Messages app and is not suitable for extracting Messages from other Apple platforms. It can be used in either of these two situations:

* You are logged into the account you want to archive. In this case, `imsg` will read your actual messages and contacts from `~/Library`
* You have backups from someone else's account. In this case, supply `-m path/to/their/Messages` directory and `-a path/to/their/address-book.abbu` export

If you have a Messages database but no contacts database directory or address book export, all threads will be exported using only contact identifiers (phone numbers, email addresses). This means the export will lack human display names and conversations with the same person across different numbers/addresses will not be merged.

## Usage

### Exporting all your messages

Export your messages and open them in a browser:

```
imsg export
```

Export a specific database of messages with a custom address book:

```
imsg export -m dads/Messages -a dads-contacts.abbu
```

### Exporting a single conversation

To export a single conversation, you can identify it by running:

```
imsg list
```

Which will produce a table like:

```
+----------+-----------+---------------------+---------------------+---------------+
| Name     | ID        | First Message at    | Last Message at     | Message Count |
+----------+-----------+---------------------+---------------------+---------------+
| Jane Doe | ab:pk:137 | 2023-06-12 08:39:40 | 2025-04-11 13:13:40 |         41073 |
+----------+-----------+---------------------+---------------------+---------------+
| Name     | ID        | First Message at    | Last Message at     | Message Count |
+----------+-----------+---------------------+---------------------+---------------+
```

The ID format depends on whether the handle matches a contact, a group chat, or an individual email/phone.

Once you have the ID you wish to export:

```
imsg export ab:pk:137
```

You'll see an archive created at `./exports/jane_doe/` and your browser will open to its generated `index.html` page.

If you're exporting a conversation between yourself and someone else from _their_ backup (as was the case when restoring chats with [our late father](https://justin.searls.co/links/2024-12-18-my-dads-obituary/)), you can add `--flip-perspective` along with their Messages & Contacts exports. You can also set the display name to their name.

Here's what that might look like:

```
./bin/imsg export ab:pk:137 -m Messages -a address-book.abbu/ --flip-perspective --display-name "Fred Searls"
```
